# income-prediction-analysis
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing for income prediction using the Adult Income Dataset. The aim is to understand how different features such as education, occupation, age, and hours worked per week influence a personâ€™s income. The analysis was performed using Pandas and visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
